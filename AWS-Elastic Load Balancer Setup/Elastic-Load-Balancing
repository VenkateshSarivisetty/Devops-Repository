##Elastic Load Balancer setup 

1. Deploy 3 servers with nginx installed.

   Take 3 EC2 webserver linux machines and install nginx 
     - #!bin/bash
        yum update -y
        sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12
        systemctl start nginx
        systemctl enable nginx
        systemctl status nginx

2. Login to each server and add extra line to index.html as webserver1 , 2 and 3.
   update index.html file under /usr/share/nginx/html and mark each location name for each webserver respectively.
   and click refresh.

3. Configure Target group and add only Webserver1 and Webserver2 only
   Note:- Make sure to add avilability zones properly becoz we cant add/update further.

4. Deploy load balance and add the target group

5. Check the load balance of requests are happening between the server 1 and 2. 

6. Add the 3rd server and check requests are going to server3 or not?

7. Delete server1 and 2 and check whether it is going to server3 alone.
