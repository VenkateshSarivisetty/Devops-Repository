What it maintain?

it maintain the system resources such as
1 - Installing application
2 - configuration
3 - Updates
4 - maintain and soon

Why configuration management tool?

Reduce managment complexity
For example - We have an enviroment Where below tools are runnning in one machine. To maintain a
high avilability will go for 

PHP
APACHE and 
MYSQL 

Infrastructure as code

Chef ensures each node compiles with policy.
policy determined by the configuration in each nodes's runlist.
reduce managment complexity through abstraction.
your policy states what state each resource should be in.

What is a resouce?

resource is a piece of system and its desired state.

file --> create/delete
user --> create/delete
package --> create/delete

Managing complexity
----------------------

1 - Organization
2 - enviroment
3 - roles
4 - nodes
5 - recipes
6 - cookbooks
7 - runlist

1) Organization: It is an independent tenant. Ex: companies/departments.

2) enviroment : enviroment reflects your pattern and workflow, and it can be used to model the life
                stages of an application
            - > development enviroment
            - > testing enviroment
            - > staging enviroment
            - > production enviroment
3) roles : Roles represents the type of servers in your Infrastructure
            
            - > Web servers
            - > DB servers
            - > LB servers

4) nodes : nodes represents the servers in your Infrastructure, it could be physical servers or virtual
           servers. It could also be network/switches/routers.

5) recipes : recipes is a collection of resources. Ex: file , application

6) cookbooks: collection of recipes and templates and custome resources.

7) runlist : runlist is  a collection of cookbooks, and every machine has its own runlist.
