##Docker - swarm

Docker swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers.

Orchestrations : Defining Service and Nodes.

Docker swarm have two types of nodes - Master(Manager) and Worker.

Every swarm start out with one Manager node desingated as the leader

swarm is higly avilable thanks to its implementation of the RAFT Algorithm.

RAFT Algorithm: The leader node is constantly checking in with its fellow manager nodes and syncing
their states.

# Command to initilize Docker swarm(2377 & 2376 or default internal orchestartion ports for swarm)
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2yn2d7srpzlltz4lscmhvhxjb0klx7zrmdy8fuo8b6ycpve91o-cewq30xs455pyol7yndnijrdb 172.31.95.204:2377  # run this command in worker node
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <host IP>
#Ingress is the default network between the swarms
Ingress netwok is used to interconnect the containers 

Ingress routing mash - This enables each node in the swarm accept the connection on published 
ports for any service running in the swarm, even if there no task running on the node.
